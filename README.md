# Math Skills Project

## Overview

This project provides a set of mathematical functions to analyze numerical data from a file. The main program reads integers from a file and calculates various statistical measures, including:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

## Files

### 1. `main.go`

The entry point of the program. It reads integers from a specified file and calculates the average, median, variance, and standard deviation using functions from the `myfunc` package.

### 2. `average.go`

Contains the `Average` function which calculates and prints the average of a list of integers.

### 3. `median.go`

Contains the `Median` function which calculates and prints the median of a list of integers. The data is sorted before calculating the median.

### 4. `variance.go`

Contains the `Variance` function which calculates and prints the variance of a list of integers.

### 5. `standard_deviation.go`

Contains the `StandardDeviation` function which calculates and prints the standard deviation of a list of integers.

## Usage

1. **Build the Program**

   To build the program, run the following command:

   ```sh
   go build -o mathskills main.go
   ```

2. **Run the Program**

   To run the program, use the following command, replacing `data.txt` with the path to your file containing integer data:

   ```sh
   ./mathskills data.txt
   ```

   The file should contain one integer per line. For example:

   ```
   10
   20
   30
   40
   50
   ```

3. **Command-Line Arguments**

   The program accepts one argument:

   - **File Name**: The path to the file containing the integer data.

   **Note**: If no arguments are provided or if there are more than one argument, the program will display an error message and exit.

## Example

Given a file `data.txt` with the following contents:

```
10
20
30
40
50
```

Running the program:

```sh
./mathskills data.txt
```

Would output:

```
Average: 30
Median: 30
Variance: 200
Standard Deviation: 14
```

## Error Handling

- If the file cannot be opened, an error message will be displayed.
- Invalid numbers in the file will be skipped.
- The program will handle cases where too few or too many arguments are provided.
